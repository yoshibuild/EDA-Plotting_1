###Readme

A partial dataset, which includes just the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02, was extracted from the original datasets. The partial dataset is called "dat_ass.RData", which includes my repository. To make plotting, just run the appropritate R scripts.

Using my scripts, Plot2, Plot3 and Plot4 are produced with three Kanji(Chinese characters) along each X axis. The characters are "木","金" and "土", which means "Thursday", "Friday" and "Saturday", respectively.
